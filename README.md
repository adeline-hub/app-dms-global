\# Build a Business Deck  

\### Data Management System — Dash Application



This application transforms raw business documents into a structured, investor‑ready deck draft.  

Rather than exposing data processing steps as technical UI, the interface visualizes the \*\*process itself\*\*.



The system is designed as a \*\*seasonal cycle\*\*, where each phase corresponds to a distinct mode of interaction and computation.

\## Concept: A Seasonal Data Cycle



Each project follows four phases:



\*\*Summer — Input\*\*  

Project intent is defined through minimal, structured inputs (sector, territory).  

The interface remains open and lightweight.



\*\*Autumn — Structure\*\*  

Source documents are collected and organized.  

The system shifts from openness to editorial structure.



\*\*Winter — Process\*\*  

Computation runs silently in the background.  

The interface withdraws to signal trust rather than progress.



\*\*Spring — Output\*\*  

The system reveals its result.  

The business deck is produced as a stable, printable artifact.



The interface never displays the deck itself. Neither keep your documents in memory.  

It visualizes the transformation that leads to it.

\## Output



The final output is generated in the background and exported as a PDF.  

The on‑screen interface remains a conceptual map of the process.

\## Stack



\- Dash (Python)

\- Plotly

\- Playwright (HTML → PDF export)

\- Render (deployment)

\## Status



This project serves as a \*\*template\*\* for data‑driven applications where process, narrative, and visual structure are treated as first‑class elements.
