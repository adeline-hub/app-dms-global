# Build a Business Deck  

## Data Management System — Dash Application

This application transforms raw business documents into a structured, investor‑ready deck draft.  
Rather than exposing data processing steps as technical UI, the interface visualizes *the process itself*.
The system is designed as a *seasonal cycle*, where each phase corresponds to a distinct mode of interaction and computation.

## Concept: A Seasonal Data Cycle

Idea : Greek myth of Persephon and how the underworld-descent / seasonal-renewal pattern shows up for three Near-Eastern goddesses; “The Descent of Inanna” (Sumerian, c. 2100 BCE) and the later Akkadian text “Ishtar’s Descent to the Netherworld.”

Each project follows four phases:

1. **Summer — Input**  

Project intent is defined through minimal, structured inputs (sector, territory).  
The interface remains open and lightweight.

2. **Autumn — Structure**  

Source documents are collected and organized.  
The system shifts from openness to editorial structure.

3. **Winter — Process**

Computation runs silently in the background.  
The interface withdraws to signal trust rather than progress.

4. **Spring — Output**

The system reveals its result.  
The business deck is produced as a stable, printable artifact.

**GRDP essentials**
The interface never displays the deck itself. Neither keep your documents in memory.  
It visualizes the transformation that leads to it.

## Output

The final output is generated in the background and exported as a PDF.  
The on‑screen interface remains a conceptual map of the process.

## Stack

- Dash (Python)
- Plotly
- Playwright (HTML → PDF export)
- Render (deployment)

---

## Status

This project serves as a **template** for data‑driven applications where process, narrative, and visual structure are treated as first‑class elements.
